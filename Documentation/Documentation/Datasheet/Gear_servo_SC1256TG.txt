The SC1256TG pushes 277.2 oz of torque and this servo is perfect for those who are running a 4x4 short course truck and don't want to blow their whole wad on their servo. The SC-1256TG sports titanium and metal gears to keep things strong and running smooth. 

Features:
Combines leading edge technology with super high 12 bit (4096) resolution and titanium gears.
Super light-weight.
Coreless motor provides high speed, incredible efficiency, and low power consumption.
Titanium gears ensure long life and durability.
The aluminum case design not only looks good but also allows for cooler and smoother operating temps.
Our servos are totally green – from materials to production, these servos are environmentally friendly.
Ideal for steering applications in 1/8 scale buggies, monster trucks and rock crawlers.

/**
 * <b>Util package</b>
 * <p>
 * The util package contains various utility classes and interfaces used throughout the application.<br/>
 * It is basically the "other" package, where everything that doesn't fit anywhere else goes.<br/>
 * Many classes here only contain static functions that are used by several controllers. For example, if
 * two controllers need to call the exact same code to set up a table, that is moved into the TableUtil class.

/**
 * <b>Controller package</b>
 * <p>
 * The controller package contains the logic binding the model ({@link com.dtucar.ecucp.model}) to the view({@link com.dtucar.ecucp.view}).<br/>
 * It contains all the functions called by the View (e.g. when the user presses a button) and has references to all the data being processed (e.g. LUT values).<br/>
 * Each view is bound to a controller (e.g. CockpitController contains all the logic behind CockpitView).
